* This class holds scan data so that we can remember where enemies were
* and what they were doing when we last scanned then.
* You could make a hashtable (with the name of the enemy bot as key)
* or a vector of these so that you can remember where all of your enemies are
* in relation to you.
* This class also holds the guessX and guessY methods. These return where our targeting
* system thinks they will be if they travel in a straight line at the same speed
* as they are travelling now.  You just need to pass the time at which you want to know
* where they will be.
